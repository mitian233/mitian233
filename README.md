# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Self Introduction

Third-rate University student. English pool. Studying PHP/Java/Kotlin/C++. 

Front-end and back-end developer. I use vue.js and Bootstrap to build front-ended apps and use Flask or PHP to build back-ended apps. 

Compared to English, communicating with me in Japanese is easier for me to understand. 

There are some pinned repositories below which are the works of my practice. 

You can get more infomations about me from my twitter. Just look left.
