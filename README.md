# About Aaki

## Introduction
Third-rate University student. English pool. Studying C/C++/Python. 

Compared to English, communicating with me in Japanese is easier for me to understand. *（このユーザーは英語が苦手ですから、日本語で話し合ってください。）*

There are some pinned repositories below which are the works of my practice.
